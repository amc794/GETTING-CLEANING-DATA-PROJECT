#### Code book for final output of run_analysis.r

This dataset contains 180 observations and 68 variables. There are 30 unique subjects in the dataset with 6 observations each corresponding to the 6 levels of activities already described in the readme file.

Features with mean and standard deviation estimates were extracted from the original dataset. Since many measurements were captured in each window of activity, there are multiple entries for each level of activity and for each subject. The variables in the final output therefore are the means of the features for each activity and for each subject.

The detail description of the features are contained in the features.info.txt file in the UCI file.
